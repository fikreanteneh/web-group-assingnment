#We choose mongo DB for our project over other relational databases because in our project we do not have any relationships among the tables.   
#As we mentioned in the above case mongo DB helped us in building our project by 
*	Allowing us to store date in native format. which  helped us to handle data which  does not have any relationships between tables
*	In case if we need to store large amount of data mongo DB will handle large this large amount of data. Which make it scalable 
*	Make our project flexible because it will allow us to change the structure of data easily which will help us to accommodate new fields and value. 
*	To maintain fast and efficient performance
